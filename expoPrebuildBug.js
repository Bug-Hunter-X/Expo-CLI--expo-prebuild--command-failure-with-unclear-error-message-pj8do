This error occurs when using the Expo CLI and is related to the `expo prebuild` command.  The error message might vary, but it essentially indicates that the prebuild process is failing, possibly due to issues with your project's dependencies, native modules, or the Expo environment itself.  A common symptom is that building for Android or iOS hangs indefinitely or fails after a period of time with an unclear error message.
