The solution to this problem depends on the root cause.  Here are some steps to diagnose and fix it:

1. **Clean your project:**
   ```bash
expo prebuild --clean
```
   This clears the build cache and can often resolve temporary issues.

2. **Check your `package.json`:**
   Carefully review your dependencies. Check for incompatible or conflicting versions. Look for libraries that might have known issues with Expo.  Update to the latest versions where possible.

3. **Inspect the logs:**
   The most informative source of information is often the logs produced by the `expo prebuild` command. Pay close attention to any error messages or warnings.  A thorough examination of the logs can point to the exact source of the failure.

4. **Handle Native Modules (if applicable):**
   If your project relies on native modules, ensure they are properly configured and linked.  Issues with these modules are a common cause of `expo prebuild` failures.

5. **Update the Expo CLI:**
   ```bash
npm install -g expo-cli
```
   An outdated Expo CLI can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior.

6. **Check for iOS/Android specific issues:**
   If the failure only occurs on one platform (Android or iOS), focus your debugging efforts on that platform's specific configuration and dependencies.
