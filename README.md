# Expo CLI `expo prebuild` Failure

This repository demonstrates a bug where the Expo CLI's `expo prebuild` command fails without providing clear error messages. The issue is likely related to dependency conflicts or problems with native modules, resulting in build hangs or failures for Android and/or iOS.

**Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Attempt to run `expo prebuild`.
4. Observe that the command either hangs indefinitely or fails with a non-descriptive error message.

**Potential Solutions (See `expoPrebuildSolution.js`):**

* **Check dependencies:** Verify that all project dependencies are compatible with Expo and each other. Check for conflicting versions.
* **Clean the project:** Use `expo prebuild --clean` to force a clean build.
* **Inspect logs:** Carefully examine the logs for clues about the failure.
* **Examine native modules:** If using native modules, ensure they are correctly configured and compatible with the Expo SDK version.
* **Update Expo CLI:** Make sure you're using the latest version of the Expo CLI.
